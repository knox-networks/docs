## Create a Wallet Tutorial
In this Knox Networks Sandbox tutotiral, we will walk through the process of creating a wallet named `Alice's Wallet` under a DFI called `Sample Bank`. We'll then inspect inside this newly created wallet.

### Step 1: Creating a New Issuer
Let's create a new issuer like in the [Creating an Issuer](./01-tutorial-create-issuer.md) called `Sample Bank` with an issuance limit of `$5000.00`.

After `Sample Bank` is good to go, let's click on it.

### Step 2: Creating a Wallet
From here, let's go to the `Bank Wallets` tab. Here, you can see another `Vault` wallet was created for the `Sample Bank` by default, which is currently empty without any CPFs.

But we are not limited to just one wallet. Let's click on the `Create Wallet` button in the top right. Let's name this wallet `Alice's Wallet`.

Awesome! Now our `Receiving Bank` has 2 separate wallets, one default one called `Vault` and one custom one called `Alice's Wallet`.

For the custom wallets, we can also change the name of the wallet by clicking the `Edit` icon and delete the wallet using the `Trash` if we so choose. But for now, let's keep the name as it is now.

### Step 3: Peek Inside the Wallet
Let's click on the details icon to see what's inside the wallet.

Currently, the wallet is empty, but once it has CPFs, we'll be able to explore any transactions that the wallet makes. In addition, we'll soon explore the adding of VCs to the wallet as a digital identity proof of concept.

### Summary
In this tutorial, we walked through the process of creating a wallet named `Alice's Wallet` under a DFI called `Sample Bank`. We then explored inside Alice's (currently empty) wallet.
