## Get/Set Issuance Limits Tutorial
In this tutorial, we will walk through the checking and setting of an issuance limit for an issuing institution. `Example Bank` will decide to request an increase in issuance of `$100.00` to bring it to `$10,000.00` from `$9,900.00`, which will be automatically approved by the Monetary Authority.

### Step 1: Create an Issuer
Please refer to and complete the creation of an issuer if you haven't already (tutorial [here](./01-tutorial-create-issuer.md)). This example will be using `Example Bank` with a current available limit of `$9,900.00 USD`.

### Step 2: Requesting an Increased Issuance Limit
The `Example Bank` now wants to request an increase in its issuance limit so it can send more CPFs to the `Sample Bank` in the future. On the top left of the `Issuance Limit` tab of `Example Limit`, we can request to increase the `Issuance Limit`.

Let's request to increase our limit by `$100.00`.

Let's click `Request Increase`.

The increase goes through for this Sandbox automatically (a real environment would have manual or automated checks instead of instant approval). We can also see after this that the `Issuance Limit` for `Example Bank` has been increased from `$9,900.00` to `$10,000.00`.

### Summary
In this tutorial, we walked through the checking and setting of an issuance limit for an issuing institution. `Example Bank` decided to request an increase in issuance of `$9,900.00` to bring it to `$10,000`, which was approved (automatically for the purposes of this tutorial) by the Monetary Authority.
